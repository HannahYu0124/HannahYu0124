# ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Kai Le (æ„·æ¨‚)

ðŸŽ“ I'm currently a second-year master's student majoring in Agricultural Science at Kyoto University, set to graduate in March 2025. Previously, I completed my bachelor's degree in Horticulture at National Taiwan University, graduating at the top of my class.

ðŸŒ± My research focuses on the application of Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) and Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) for the quality assessment of lychee fruit products, aiming to improve pre-grading processes for the Japanese market. I have a strong background in analytical techniques such as High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), gained from my experience as a research assistant at the Taiwan University Fruit Research Laboratory.

ðŸ’» In addition to my agricultural studies, I have a keen interest in IT and technology, aspiring to contribute to the development of new IT technologies and shape the future of the industry. I am fluent in Chinese, English, Japanese, and French, making me confident in international communication.

ðŸŽ¨ Outside of academia, I am passionate about painting, particularly watercolor, and enjoy exploring various artistic mediums, including digital art, oil pastels, and traditional Chinese painting.

ðŸ“š I am dedicated to continuous learning and personal growth, always eager to take on new challenges and opportunities. Feel free to connect with me to discuss research, technology, or art!

Let's create something amazing together! ðŸš€
